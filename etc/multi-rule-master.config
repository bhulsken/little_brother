# Logging level of the application. Default: INFO
# Allowed values: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR

# Run the application in debugging mode. If active any exception will print a
# stack trace and terminate the application. Do not activate in "production" mode.
# Default: False
#debug_mode=True

[AppControl]

# If active, the processes on the host will be checked. Use "False" if users
# do not log onto the master host. Default: True
#scan_active = False

# Sets the number of days that user play statistics will be available in the frontend.
# Default: 7
#process_lookback_in_days = 14

# Sets the number of future days that user play time configuration will be available in the frontend.
# Default: 7

#hostname = MY.BEAUTIFIED.HOSTNAME

# Set the minimum duration in seconds that a process has to be active to be considered relevant "play time".
# Default: 60. Increase if there e.g. are short scheduled processes running on the hosts matching the patterns
# of "play" processes.
#min_activity_duration = 120

[MasterConnector]

# Unique token that identifies a slave host with the master host. It has to match the
# corresponding entry on the slave hosts.
# access_token=SOME_LONG_AND_SECRET_TOKEN

[ClientProcessHandler]
# Interval in seconds between two checks of the processes on a host. Default: 10
# Since reading the process table is often a time-consuming task it may be suitable to increase
# this value to about 20-60 seconds.
#check_interval = 20


[ClientDeviceHandler]
# Interval in seconds between two pings to configured monitored devices. Default: 10
# Since pinging is often a time-consuming task it may be suitable to increase this value to about 30-60 seconds.
#check_interval = 30

# Path of the "ping" utility. Default: /bin/ping

# Regular expression to extract the round trip time from a ping call. Use paranthethes to mark the actual time duration

# Select the engine of the speech output.
# Permitted values:
# * pyttsx3 : Use the library of the same name to generate the speech output. (Default)
# * google : Use the libray 'python_google_speak' to generate the speech output. Note that this library requires an
#            internet connection!
# * external : Use an external command to generate the speech output. See setting 'speech_generator_cmd_line'.

#cache_audio_files = True

# Set the speed of the speech generator in words per minutes. Default: 100

# Set the command line for the external speech generation tool.
# Default: /usr/bin/festival --tts --language american_english {inline}
# The command line may contain the following patterns will be replaced before its execution:
# * {infile} : name of a file containing the text to be spoken
# * {text}: text to be spoken

[StatusServer]

# Set IP address that the webserver will listen to. Default: 0.0.0.0, hence it will listen to all local interfaces.
#host=localhost

# Set the port number, the webserver will listen to. Default: None, hence the webserver will not be started.

# Set the password for the administration user ("admin"). Default: None
admin_password=SOME_SECRET_PASSWORD

# Set a unique secret which will be used to generate HTML cookies
app_secret=SOME_OTHER_LONG_AND_SECRET_TOKEN

# The remaining part of the configuration file is for defining rulesets describing which user is allowed to access
# the computer during which time periods.
# For a more detailed description see https://github.com/marcus67/little_brother

# This is a simple ruleset for a user (user1) consisting of a simple rule:
# * All processes matching 'sh' will be tracked.
# * No access before 16:00 hours (4PM) or after 23:00 hours (11PM).
# * The overall access time is limited to 1 hour and 30 minutes.

#
# * All processes matching shells or systemd sessions will be tracked.
