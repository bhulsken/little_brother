# Interval in seconds between two checks of the processes on a host. Default: 10
# Since reading the process table is often a time-consuming task it may be suitable to increase
# this value to about 20-60 seconds.

# The remaining part of the configuration file is for defining rulesets describing which user is allowed to access
# the computer during which time periods.
# For a more detailed description see https://github.com/marcus67/little_brother

# This is a simple ruleset for a user (user1) consisting of a simple rule:
# * All processes matching 'sh' will be tracked.
# * No access before 16:00 hours (4PM) or after 23:00 hours (11PM).
# * The overall access time is limited to 1 hour and 30 minutes.
# * The maximum access time per session is 20 minutes.
# * After each access session there will have to be a break period of at least 10 minutes.
# * No free play mode (default).
